I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Brandeis University](http://www.brandeis.edu/) working with Professor [Marcelle Soares-Santos](https://www.brandeis.edu/departments/physics/people/faculty/soares-santos.html). My main field is Observational Cosmology, and I am particularly interested in understanding the formation and evolution of the Universe through the analysis of astronomical data from wide field surveys.

I am member of the [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) (DES) and the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Dark Energy Science Collaboration](http://www.lsst-desc.org/) (LSST-DESC). Currently, DES is the project with the most precise measurements of the large-scale structure of the Universe using multiple observational probes. In the 2020's, LSST will surpass DES with much more statistics and depth. Besides these big collaborations, I am also involved with smaller but still very interesting projects such as the SOAR GRavitational Arc Survey (SOGRAS), the CFHT Stripe 82 survey (CS82), the VISTA-CFHT Stripe 82 survey (VICS82) and the Blanco i-band Kilo-degree survey (BlinK).     


DES
======
The DES is an optical imaging survey that will observe, in 5.5 years, 5000 square degrees of the celestial southern hemisphere with a 570 megapixels camera with red-sensitive CCDs (DECam) installed on the 4m Blanco Telescope, located at the [Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/) (CTIO) in Chile. DES uses the $grizY$ bands to obtain photometric redshifts and will reach limiting magnitudes of $i \sim 24$ when finalized.

The observations are carried out during roughly one semester per year, and the first season took place in 2012-2013, a period called Science Verification (SV). The SV data covered 250 square degrees reaching almost the depth of the complete survey. For this dataset, a thorough search for strong gravitational lensing systems was carried out, involving several selection criteria and including the visual inspection of the images. I had an active participation in this search, which identified 53 candidate systems, 6 of which were later confirmed by spectroscopic observations.

Recently, the first results using data from a full operating season of DES, the so-called year 1 (Y1) data set, were made [public](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/news-and-results/publications/). The Y1 data covers 1500 sq.-deg at 40% of the final depth of the survey. The data from the third season, Y3 (covering 5000 sq.-deg at 50% of the depth), has already been processed, but the catalogs are still being vetted. The data taking for Y5 has already been completed. Currently, I am working in the weak mass calibration of the Y1 redMaPPer clusters using a new mass proxy named $\mu_{\star}$. I am also involved in the generation of the Y3 (cosmic shear) measurements to be used in the main cosmology analysis of the survey.     

LSST
======

The [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope](https://www.lsst.org/) (LSST) project will conduct a 10-year survey of the sky that will deliver a huge amount of images and data products that will address some of the most pressing questions<sup>[1]</sup> about the structure and evolution of the Universe such as:

* What is the mysterious dark energy (DE) that is driving the acceleration of the cosmic expansion?
* What is dark matter (DM), how is it distributed?
* How the DM properties affect the formation of stars, galaxies, and larger structures?
* How did the Milky Way form?
* What is the nature of the outer regions of the solar system?
* Is it possible to make a complete inventory of potentially hazardous smaller bodies in the solar system?
* Are there new exotic and explosive phenomena in the Universe that have not yet been discovered?

However, by now the researchers involved in LSST-DESC are working in the development of simulations to test the pipelines that will be used when the survey starts to have data. I am interested to use the LSST-DESC DC2 simulations to apply a cluster finding pipeline that is being developed by our group, the [Voronoi Tessellation Cluster Finder](https://github.com/SSantosLab/vt-clustertools). In this pipeline we do not need to assume the presence of a red-sequence to identify the clusters. This can be an advantage when we go to higher redshifts (which will be the case of LSST) where the red-sequence might not be formed yet.

BlinK
======

The Blanco i-band Kilo-degree Survey (BlinK) is a 1000 sq.-deg survey in the i-band with DECam down to $mag_{AB}$: 22.5. The data from this survey will enable us to study galaxy clusters, discover new strong lensing systems, study Lyman Break Analog Systems, find new star-forming early-type galaxies, study compact and fossil groups, in addition to carry out studies of large-scale structure and correlation with other wavelengths. Our kilo-degree field has not been previously explored in the i-band to the proposed depth nor with the DECam image quality and will benefit from existing spectroscopic data from SDSS and WiggleZ, and multi-wavelength data from other surveys, including existing DECam $grz$ data. This program builds up on the CFHT Stripe 82 (CS82) i-band survey and will be performed in close collaboration with the Blanco Imaging of the Southern Sky (BLISS) project and other DECam surveys. In addition to being a survey on its own, this project will have an impact on the current landscape of wide-field surveys, complementing the growing coverage of the extragalactic sky for dec < 30 deg. It can provide support to other surveys in the field, such as [J-PLUS](http://j-plus.es), and have a legacy value for targeting spectroscopic surveys or complementing the wavelength coverage of imaging surveys. BlinK can provide an excellent dataset to test our cluster finding algorithm and can have applications for weak lensing and photo-z measurements.  

CS82
======

CS82 is a collaboration involving researchers from several countries, which used French, Canadian and Brazilian time on
the [Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope](http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/) (CFHT) --- a 3.6 meter aperture (optical and infrared) telescope located on Mount Mauna Kea, Hawaii --- to image $\approx 170$ square degrees ($-42.5<RA <45$ and $-1<DEC<+1$) in the Stripe 82.

Motivated by the high availability of data at different wavelengths in that region, a group of collaborators designed CS82 to be the weak lensing survey on Stripe 82, profiting from the excellent image quality provided by the CFHT telescope. The region was imaged in the $i$ band, providing data with a depth up to $i=23.5$ with excellent seeing conditions (average value of $ 0.6^{\prime\prime}$). The CS82 survey also motivated a new survey in the infrared, VICS82.

I worked estimating the morphological parameters of the objects by modeling the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the images and fitting brightness profiles to the objects. I carried out several tests to optimize the generation of these morphology catalogs. I have also performed a stack weak lensing analysis for this survey by the combination with the produced shear catalog and the SDSS redMaPPer cluster public catalog. Due to my contributions to the survey I was considered part of the _core team_ of the project.

SOGRAS
======

The SOAR GRavitational Arc Survey (SOGRAS) project observed 47 massive clusters, most of them in Stripe 82, to search for strong lensing features. The observations were made in the $g^{\prime}r^{\prime}i^{\prime}$ bands of the $4.2m$ [SOAR telescope](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/soar/) located at Cerro PachÃ³n (Chile). I participated in the selection of these clusters and they were observed at two redshift intervals ($z\simeq 0.3$ and $z\simeq 0.5 $) with a seeing $\le 0.8^{\prime\prime}$. Four clusters in this sample that have very good arc candidates were followed-up for deeper imaging and multi-object spectroscopy with the Gemini South Telescope, aiming to determine their dynamical masses and to improve the shape measurements for deriving weak lensing masses. I performed preliminary weak lensing mass measurements for this sample.

### Abstract

$\mu_{\star}$ is a galaxy cluster mass proxy corresponding to the total stellar mass of red and blue members (see Palmese et al., 2018 for more details). Palmese et al. 2018 showed that the scatter in the $\mu_{\star}$ to X-ray temperature relation is comparable to the results of other mass proxies for an X-ray selected sample. Since $\mu_{\star}$ has a clear physical meaning and is independent of the history of the formation of the red sequence, it seems to be a good motivation to study the clusterâ€™s mass with this mass proxy, especially at high redshifts, where we might have a not well defined red sequence. In this work, we propose to perform a weak lensing mass calibration of $\mu_{\star}$ at high redshifts using the DES Y1 redMaPPer clusters and the Metacalibration shear catalog. A previous weak lensing mass calibration of $\mu_{\star}$ (Pereira et al., 2018) using the public SDSS redMaPPer catalog at low redshift presented promising results but with low statistics. The use of DES Y1 redMaPPer cluster sample will allow us to go to high redshifts and improve our error measurements once this dataset presents larger statistics than the SDSS redMaPPer sample and a shear catalog with very precise measurements of the background sources.

### Summary

The event brought together students and researchers, from different backgrounds on Astronomy and related areas, for a very dynamical hacker marathon in different projects related to computer programming and statistics. The organization asked the participants to suggest projects to be worked during the marathon, a perfect opportunity to present research from my undergoing Ph.D. In this project I am interested to perform weak lensing mass measurements of galaxy clusters in the CFHT Stripe 82 survey. The challenge part of it was to use Bayesian inference and MCMC approaches to perform the model-fitting of the data. After I presented my project, another three participants were interested to join in and together we were able to fully learn and develop solutions for it. That is the essence of AHW: in a short time, we can meet people who can give very helpful insights in statistical and computing questions. In the AHW I also was encouraged to work collaboratively with people who are not familiar with my subject and to share my work with them through open source tools.

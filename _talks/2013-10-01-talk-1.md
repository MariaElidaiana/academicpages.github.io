### Abstract

We present the determination of galaxy structural parameters in the CFHT/MegaCam Stripe-82 Survey (CS82) stacked images. The CS82 survey covered an area of $\~170$ square degrees with the CFHT $3.6m$ telescope in a field determined by $-40<RA<45$ and $-1 <DEC<1$ (within the SDSS stripe-82 region) in $i$-band to a depth of $mag_{AB} \sim 24$. Its excellent image quality (mean seeing of $\~0.6$) and uniformity makes CS82 specially suitable for applications involving gravitational lensing and galaxy morphology. In this work we present the determination of galaxy structural parameters, which has applications to galaxy evolution studies, weak lensing through the effect of magnification, and the improvement of the photometry in other surveys (e.g. SDSS), through the ``forced photometry'' method. In this work the morphological analysis of galaxies is performed through a profile fitting method implemented with SExtractor+PSFEx. First, we use SExtractor to perform the detection and obtain basic measurements of objects, then we use PSFEx to model the PSF across the field, and, finally, we run SExtractor again to perfom the model-fitting of objects. In this work we use 4 models implemented in SExtractor: SÃ©rcic, de Vaucouleurs, exponential and 2-component de Vaucouleurs+exponential. We discuss some applications of these results, such as the evolution of galaxy sizes and the measurement of the lensing magnification signal combining precise photometry, counts and sizes.

### Summary

The event brought together students and researchers, from different backgrounds on Astronomy and related areas, for a very dynamical hacker marathon in different projects related to computer programming and statistics. The organization asked the participants to suggest projects to be worked during the marathon. I was interested to learn basic concepts of the Bayesian inference and MCMC approaches to perform the model-fitting of the data. I worked in a project with another three participants to learn the basics of Bayesian Inference. At the end of the event, we were able to develop an full example of model-fitting using Bayesian inference and MCMC.

### Abstract

Galaxy clusters are powerful tools to study the content and evolution of the Universe. Determining their abundances as a function of mass and redshift is one of the main observables for current and forthcoming surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). They act as gravitational lenses and a widely used
method to obtain their average (weak lensing) mass is based on the stack measurements of the tangential shear profiles. In general, a mass-observable relation is required to connect the observable and the true halo mass. However, this mass-calibration is still challenging since there are different cluster samples and definitions of the mass proxies. In this work, we use the stack weak lensing of redMaPPer and Voronoi Tessellation galaxy clusters in the SDSS Stripe 82 to estimate their masses and to obtain the mass-calibration using the richness $\lambda$ and the new stellar-mass based mass proxy $\mu_{\star}$.
